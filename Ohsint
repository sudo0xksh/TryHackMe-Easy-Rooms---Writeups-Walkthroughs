# OhSINT — TryHackMe (OSINT) 🕵️‍♂️🌍🧩

OhSINT was my **first OSINT-based CTF**, and it made one thing very clear:

> You don’t need exploits when people leak their lives online.

No ports.  
No shells.  
No payloads.

Just public data, bad habits, and patience.

---

## Challenge Overview 📌🔍

This challenge focused entirely on **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**.

Goal (on paper):
👉 Collect publicly available information and correlate it to uncover sensitive details.

Reality:
👉 Tiny leaks. Multiple platforms. One careless human.

---

## Initial Footprint Discovery 👣📱

The investigation began with identifying the target’s online presence.

The first strong lead came from **Twitter** 🐦

From the account:
- Posting patterns  
- Technical references  
- Casual mentions  

These details helped build a baseline profile of the target.

Nothing dangerous alone —  
but OSINT is about **patterns**, not single posts.

---

## Wireless Metadata Exposure 📡😬

While scrolling through posts, something spicy appeared 👀

👉 A **BSSID** was unintentionally disclosed.

This might look harmless, but in OSINT:

BSSID = location breadcrumb 🧠

Using public wireless databases:
- The associated **SSID** was identified  
- The **geographical location** of the network was mapped  

Physical location: narrowed.  
Confidence level: rising.

---

## Location Correlation 🌍✈️

With location data in hand, correlation began.

The target maintained a **personal website** where:
- Travel experiences were shared  
- A recent vacation location was mentioned  

Cross-referencing this with the wireless data confirmed consistency.

OSINT rule #1:
👉 If multiple sources agree, you’re probably right.

---

## Developer Footprint Analysis 💻🔎

Next stop: technical platforms.

A **GitHub profile** linked to the target was discovered.

From GitHub:
- Email address exposed 📧  
- Repository history visible  
- Activity timeline mapped  

Digital footprint expanded nicely.

---

## Credential Exposure 🔑💀

Then came the real facepalm moment 🤦‍♂️

While reviewing the target’s website more closely:

👉 Page source revealed a **plaintext password**

No obfuscation.  
No hashing.  
Just vibes.

At this point, the challenge was basically done.

---

## Outcome 🏁✅

By correlating:

- Social media behavior  
- Wireless metadata  
- Location intelligence  
- Developer platform exposure  
- Horrible credential hygiene  

The objective was completed using **only public information**.

No exploitation.  
No brute force.  
No illegal access.

Just OSINT doing what it does best.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- OSINT is about correlation, not complexity  
- Small leaks across platforms compound fast  
- Metadata (like BSSID) is dangerous  
- Developers overshare more than they realize  
- Security failures usually start *before* hacking

## Final Words ☕😌

OhSINT proves one brutal truth:

> “People leak more than systems ever will.”

No hacks.  
No tools.  
Just attention to detail.

OSINT box.  
Real-world lesson.
