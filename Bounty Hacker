# Bounty Hacker — TryHackMe (Easy) 💰🏴‍☠️🐧

Bounty Hacker is a Linux Easy box that politely hands you the keys and says  
**“please don’t tell anyone how easy this was.”**

No exploits.  
No brute-force drama.  
Just **anonymous FTP, leaked creds, and a misconfigured binary begging to be abused**.

---

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: Bounty Hacker  
Target IP: 10.10.141.37  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine focuses on **service exposure**, **lazy access controls**, and a **GTFOBins special** to finish things off.

Basically: everything attackers love, all in one place.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍👀

Started with the ritual scan — because guessing is for amateurs.

nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap.txt 10.10.141.37

Open ports discovered:

21/tcp   FTP     vsftpd 3.0.3 📂  
22/tcp   SSH     OpenSSH 7.2p2 🔐  
80/tcp   HTTP    Apache 2.4.18 🌐  

One thing stood out immediately 🚨  
👉 **Anonymous FTP login was enabled**

At that moment, the rest of the machine mentally checked out.

---

## Web Enumeration (Port 80) 🌐😐

Visited the website.

Found:
- A very boring page  
- No input fields  
- No fun  

Still ran directory enumeration because trust issues.

dirsearch -u http://10.10.141.37 -e php,html,js

Results:
- Multiple .htaccess paths (403 — rude)  
- /images/ directory accessible  
- /server-status present but locked  

Nothing juicy here.  
The web server was just… existing.

---

## FTP Enumeration (Port 21) 📁😏

FTP deserved attention because **anonymous access was enabled** (red flag the size of a building).

First tried usernames found on the website — no luck.

Then tried the obvious move that somehow everyone forgets:

👉 Anonymous login.

And yes — it worked.

Inside FTP, two files were waiting patiently.

Files downloaded:
- tasks.txt  
- locks.txt  

---

## Credential Discovery 🔑📜

Reading the files felt like opening a gift 🎁

tasks.txt:
- Contained a **valid username**

locks.txt:
- Contained a **list of passwords**
- Looked suspiciously like a ready-made wordlist

At this point the machine basically said:  
**“Please SSH into me.”**

---

## SSH Access (Port 22) 🔓😎

Combined:
- Username from tasks.txt  
- Passwords from locks.txt  

Eventually, one password worked.

Result:
- User-level shell obtained  
- Partial compromise achieved  

No alerts.  
No resistance.  
Just vibes.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀🔥

After landing a shell, post-exploitation enumeration began.

Sudo permissions and binary access were checked.

One binary stood out:

👉 **tar**

Instead of trusting it blindly, its behavior was checked on **GTFOBins** (as one should).

And surprise surprise…

tar + elevated permissions = root shell 💀

---

## Privilege Escalation via tar 🧨😈

Using the GTFOBins method, tar was abused to spawn a root shell.

No kernel exploits.  
No memory corruption.  
Just **a misconfiguration doing all the work**.

---

## Root Access 🏁👑

- Root shell obtained  
- Root access confirmed  
- Full system compromise achieved  

Machine officially buried.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Anonymous FTP is still a security nightmare  
- Sensitive files don’t belong on public services  
- Password lists are weapons when attackers find them  
- Misconfigured binaries turn “low privilege” into “who needs exploits?”  
- Basic mistakes are enough to lose the entire system
