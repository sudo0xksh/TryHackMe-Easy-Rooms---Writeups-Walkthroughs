# Wgel CTF — TryHackMe (Easy) 🧇🔑🐧

Wgel CTF is that box which tests **patience more than payloads**.  
Slow website.  
Random disconnects.  
And then suddenly… a private SSH key just chilling in public.

No exploits.  
No brute force.  
Just information disclosure doing overtime.

---

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: Wgel CTF  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx (changes more than moods)  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine focuses on **web enumeration**, **source code analysis**,  
**SSH key abuse for initial access**, and a **creative sudo misuse** to wrap things up.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍👀

Started with the usual recon ritual.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Services discovered:

22/tcp   SSH     OpenSSH 7.2p2 🔐  
80/tcp   HTTP    Apache 2.4.18 🌐  

Only SSH and HTTP exposed.  
Which usually means:  
👉 *“The website knows something.”*

---

## Initial Enumeration Challenges 😤🐢

Enumeration wasn’t smooth at first.

- Automated directory tools ❌ unreliable  
- Website ❌ slow and unstable  

Instead of forcing scans, the smart move was made:

👉 Disconnect. Reconnect later. Chill.

After reconnecting, the target behaved and enumeration resumed normally.

Lesson learned: sometimes **patience > tools**.

---

## Web Application Enumeration 🌐🧐

Further inspection revealed content under:

👉 **/sitemap/**

Inside it were multiple names, likely users:

- Dave Miller  
- Emily Turner  
- Adam Morris  
- Noah Nelson  
- Dorothy Murphy  

Nothing worked immediately,  
but it confirmed **user information leakage** through the web app.

---

## Source Code Analysis 🧠💻

Digging into the page source (because trust issues) paid off.

Found a more interesting username:

👉 **jesse**

Unlike the others, this one appeared in a technical context.

Red flag 🚩 raised.

Continued poking revealed something far worse.

---

## SSH Key Disclosure 🔑💀

Further enumeration exposed a private SSH key sitting inside a **.ssh directory**.

Yes.  
A private key.  
Publicly accessible.

Security score: zero.

Used the key to attempt SSH access.

Result?

✅ Login successful  
✅ User shell obtained  

Authentication bypassed without passwords or guessing.

---

## Initial Foothold 🐾😎

At this point:

- Initial access established  
- user.txt flag captured  

The box officially belonged to us.

Time to mess with sudo.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀🔥

Post-exploitation enumeration revealed a spicy sudo rule:

👉 The user could run **wget** as root.

wget doesn’t look dangerous…  
until you remember what it can do.

Checked behavior.  
Checked GTFOBins.

Smile activated 😈

---

## Root Flag Exfiltration 📤👑

Using wget’s `--post-file` functionality:

- Root flag contents were exfiltrated  
- Sent directly to a controlled Netcat listener  

Result:
- Root flag obtained  
- Root access effectively achieved  
- Full system compromise confirmed  

Who needs a shell when you can steal data quietly?

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Slow or unstable services sometimes need patience, not brute force  
- Source code leaks are extremely powerful  
- Exposed SSH private keys are game over  
- “Safe” binaries like wget become weapons with sudo  
- Understanding tools beats exploit hunting

## Final Words ☕😌

Wgel CTF proves one simple truth:

> “If your SSH keys are public, your server already isn’t.”

Slow start.  
One mistake.  
Free root.

Easy box.  
Very real lessons.
