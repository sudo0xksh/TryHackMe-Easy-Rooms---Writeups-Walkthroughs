# LazyAdmin — TryHackMe (Easy) 🛋️😴🐧

LazyAdmin is exactly what the name promises.  
An admin so relaxed that the server basically hacks itself.

Outdated CMS.  
Backup files on the internet.  
File upload with zero trust issues.

Free root. No complaints.

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: LazyAdmin  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine revolves around **web enumeration**, **abusing an outdated CMS**,  
**credential disclosure via backup files**, and a smooth ride to root.

The admin did the heavy lifting. We just showed up.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍👀

Started with the usual “what did you expose today?” scan.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Services discovered:

22/tcp   SSH     OpenSSH 7.2p2 🔐  
80/tcp   HTTP    Apache 2.4.18 🌐  

Linux 4.x kernel detected.  
Only SSH and HTTP open — clean, boring… or so it seemed.

---

## Web Enumeration (Port 80) 🌐🧐

Visiting the website showed the **default Apache page**.

Which usually means:
👉 The real app is hiding somewhere else.

Directory enumeration was performed and eventually revealed something juicy 👀

An **outdated SweetRice CMS** installation.

At that moment, the box’s fate was sealed.

---

## CMS Analysis & Credential Disclosure 🍚💀

Digging into SweetRice vulnerabilities revealed something beautiful:

👉 **Backup file disclosure**

Backup files were accessible publicly.  
Downloaded without authentication.  
No resistance. Zero shame.

Inside those backups?

- Configuration files  
- **Manager credentials**  

No brute force.  
No guessing.  
Just straight-up leaked admin access.

---

## Admin Panel Access 🔑😎

Used the recovered credentials to log into the SweetRice admin panel.

Result:
- Admin access confirmed  
- Full CMS control achieved  

From here, server-side access was just a formality.

---

## Initial Access via File Upload 📂💣

The CMS allowed file uploads with basically no validation.

Which meant one thing:

👉 Upload a malicious `.phtml` file.

Triggered the uploaded file and boom 💥

- Reverse shell obtained  
- Initial foothold secured  
- First flag captured  

Server officially unhappy.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀🔥

Post-exploitation enumeration followed.

Misconfigurations were everywhere.  
Trust was misplaced.  
Boundaries were imaginary.

Without any kernel exploits or fancy tricks:

👉 Root privileges were obtained.

---

## Root Access 🏁👑

- Root access confirmed  
- Root flag captured  
- Full system compromise achieved  

LazyAdmin lived up to the name.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Outdated CMS installations are free real estate  
- Backup files should NEVER be public  
- Credential disclosure kills security instantly  
- Poor file upload validation = instant RCE  
- Simple laziness can destroy an entire system

## Final Words ☕😌

LazyAdmin teaches one eternal truth:

> “If the admin is lazy, attackers don’t have to work.”

Basic enumeration.  
Public backups.  
Free root.

Easy box.  
Painful mistakes.
