# Ignite — TryHackMe (Easy) 🔥💻🐧

Ignite is that box which doesn’t even try to hide.  
It literally tells you **which CMS it’s running**, keeps **default creds**,  
and then politely allows **RCE + root**.

No puzzles.  
No resistance.  
Just bad decisions, stacked neatly.

---

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: Ignite  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine focuses on **CMS identification**, **remote code execution**,  
and **privilege escalation via exposed configuration files**.

In short: the CMS did all the work for us.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍👀

Started with the standard scan to see what the server exposed.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Service discovered:

80/tcp   HTTP   Apache 2.4.18 🌐  
Application: **Fuel CMS** ⛽🔥  

The CMS was visible straight away, which instantly narrowed the attack surface.

When a box tells you the tech stack upfront,  
it’s usually about to regret it.

---

## Web Enumeration (Port 80) 🌐🧐

Directory enumeration was performed to locate admin panels and hidden paths.

Interesting endpoints discovered:

/home  
/index.php  
/offline  
/robots.txt  

robots.txt was especially helpful (as usual).

Inside it, a disallowed path stood out:

👉 **/fuel**

Which just happened to be the Fuel CMS admin panel.

Subtlety level: zero.

---

## CMS Access 🔑😎

Navigated to `/fuel` and found the login page.

Even better — the homepage casually revealed **default credentials**  
that were still active 🤦‍♂️

Username: admin  
Password: admin  

Logged in successfully.

At this point, the CMS was completely exposed to authenticated attacks.

---

## Remote Code Execution 💣🔥

The target was running **Fuel CMS version 1.4**,  
a version known for having **remote code execution vulnerabilities**.

Abused the RCE to gain command execution on the system.

Result:
- Reverse shell obtained  
- Initial foothold achieved  

Web app officially on fire 🔥

---

## Post-Exploitation Enumeration 🔎🧠

After landing on the box, privilege escalation was evaluated.

Considered:
- pkexec (CVE-2021-4034) ❌ not vulnerable  

Instead of forcing kernel exploits, the smarter move was to look back at:

👉 **Application files**

Because apps love leaking secrets.

---

## Credential Discovery 🔑📜

Inside the web application files, a familiar mistake was found.

A configuration file:

👉 **database.php**

And inside it?

Plaintext database credentials 😌

These credentials belonged to a **privileged user**  
and were reusable directly on the system.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀👑

Using the credentials extracted from the configuration file:

- Privileged access obtained  
- Root shell achieved  
- Root flag captured  

Full system compromise completed.

No kernel bugs.  
No exploit chains.  
Just exposed configs doing their thing.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- CMS identification during recon saves massive effort  
- Default credentials are still everywhere (somehow)  
- Outdated CMS versions often equal instant RCE  
- Configuration files are treasure chests for attackers  
- Application misconfigurations beat kernel exploits every time

## Final Words ☕😌

Ignite teaches one brutal lesson:

> “If your CMS is outdated, your server is already compromised.”

Fast recon.  
Zero resistance.  
Free root.

Easy box.  
Classic mistakes.
