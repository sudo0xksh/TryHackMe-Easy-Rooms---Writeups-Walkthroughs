# Cyborg — TryHackMe (Easy) 🤖💾🐧

Cyborg is one of those machines that doesn’t get hacked —  
it **slowly explains itself** until you accidentally become root.

No flashy exploits.  
No kernel panic.  
Just backups, hashes, and a script that should’ve never seen sudo.

---

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: Cyborg  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine is all about **web enumeration**, **backup archive abuse**,  
**credential recovery**, and a **backup script that chose violence**.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍👀

Started with the usual “what did you expose?” scan.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Services discovered:

22/tcp   SSH     OpenSSH 7.2p2 🔐  
80/tcp   HTTP    Apache 2.4.18 🌐  

Linux 4.x kernel detected.  
Only SSH and HTTP exposed — clean, boring, suspicious.

---

## Web Enumeration (Port 80) 🌐🧐

Visiting the website showed…  
👉 **Default Apache page**

Nothing custom.  
Nothing exciting.  
Which usually means the good stuff is hiding somewhere else.

Further enumeration revealed something interesting 👀

A password hash casually sitting around:

music_archive:$apr1$BpZ.Q.1m$F0qqPwHSOG50URuOVQTTn.

At the time it didn’t unlock anything,  
but it smelled like **“this will matter later.”**

And it did 😏

---

## User Enumeration & Archive Discovery 📁🕵️‍♂️

While digging deeper, multiple usernames popped up:

- josh  
- adam  
- alex  

Also found something far more exciting:

👉 **archive.tar**

Downloaded it immediately because nothing good ever comes from random archives.

Inside the extracted data were config files referencing backup-related structures.

Attack path officially changed direction.

---

## Backup Technology Identification 🧠💾

Looking at the archive structure raised a familiar flag 🚩

This wasn’t random junk —  
👉 It was **Borg Backup**.

Instead of hunting for bugs, the focus shifted to understanding how Borg works.

Turns out:
- Borg repositories are usually protected by **passphrases**
- No exploit needed — just the right password

So… back to that hash 👀

---

## Credential Recovery 🔑🧨

The earlier hash was revisited and identified as an **APR (MD5) hash**.

After controlled cracking attempts:

Recovered credentials:

music_archive : squidward

Using this password, the Borg backup repository was successfully extracted.

And inside it…  
things escalated quickly.

---

## Initial Access 🔓😎

Within the extracted backup data, a file inside **alex’s directory** revealed:

alex : S3cretP@s3

Tried SSH with these creds.

Result?

✅ Login successful  
✅ User shell obtained  
✅ user.txt flag captured  

Partial compromise achieved.  
Time to annoy sudo.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀🔥

Post-exploitation enumeration revealed something spicy 🌶️

The current user could run a script as root:

👉 **backup.sh**

Direct editing? ❌  
Permissions? Locked.

But scripts don’t need editing to be dangerous 😈

Reviewing the logic showed that it executed commands in a way that allowed  
**arbitrary command execution as root** if you knew how to talk to it nicely.

So we did.

---

## Root Access 🏁👑

By abusing the script’s execution flow:

- Root-level command execution achieved  
- Root shell obtained  
- root.txt flag captured  

Machine officially dismantled.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Default web pages often hide clues elsewhere  
- Password hashes found early can decide the entire attack chain  
- Backups deserve stronger protection than production  
- Understanding systems beats exploit hunting  
- Sudo + scripts = instant regret

## Final Words ☕😌

Cyborg teaches a simple lesson:

> “If your backups are weak, your system already lost.”

Calm enumeration.  
Basic understanding.  
Free root.

Easy box.  
Dangerous assumptions.
