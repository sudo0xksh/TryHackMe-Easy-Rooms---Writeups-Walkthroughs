# Brooklyn Nine-Nine — TryHackMe (Easy) 🚔😂🐧

Brooklyn Nine-Nine is an Easy Linux box that feels less like hacking  
and more like binge-watching a sitcom where **everyone leaks credentials by accident**.

No exploits.  
No pain.  
Just anonymous FTP, stego magic, and sudo doing sudo things.

Nine-Nine! 🫡

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: Brooklyn Nine-Nine  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine revolves around **poor access controls**, **theme-based credentials**,  
and a **GTFOBins-certified privilege escalation** to wrap things up nicely.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍👀

Started with a standard TCP scan to see what the precinct left unlocked.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Open ports discovered:

21/tcp   FTP     vsftpd 3.0.3 📂  
22/tcp   SSH     OpenSSH 7.6p1 🔐  
80/tcp   HTTP    Apache 2.4.29 🌐  

Linux 4.x kernel detected.  
FTP, SSH, and HTTP all exposed.

But one thing screamed louder than Boyle at lunch time:

👉 **Anonymous FTP was enabled**

Yikes.

---

## Enumeration Weirdness 🤨⚠️

While running Gobuster and extra scans, the box started acting… moody.

- ICMP ping? Stable ✅  
- Website? Accessible ✅  
- Active enumeration tools? Randomly failing ❌  

Instead of brute-forcing scans like a maniac, the approach shifted to **manual service inspection**.

And that decision paid off.

---

## FTP Enumeration (Port 21) 📁😏

Anonymous login worked without any resistance.

Inside FTP, a single file was sitting there like it *wanted* to be read.

File found:
- note_to_jake.txt 📝

Reading it revealed usernames straight out of the show:

- jake  
- amy  
- holt  

At this point, it was clear the machine was **theme-based**  
(and probably hiding creds somewhere dumb).

---

## Credential Discovery via Steganography 🖼️🕵️‍♂️

While poking around the web directory, an image popped up:

brooklyn99.jpg

No uploads.  
No forms.  
No exploits.

So naturally… stego time 😈

Used steghide to extract hidden data from the image.

And boom 💥

Extracted credential:

Holt’s password:
fluffydog12@ninenine

Case closed.

---

## Initial Access via SSH 🔑😎

Used the recovered credentials to SSH into the machine.

Login successful.

Results:
- User-level shell obtained  
- user.txt flag captured  

Now it was time to go from **detective** to **commissioner**.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀🔥

Post-exploitation enumeration showed that user **holt** had sudo permissions.

One binary stood out immediately:

👉 **nano**

Normally harmless.  
But with sudo?  
Nano becomes… dangerous 😈

Checked GTFOBins (as tradition demands).

And yes — nano can escape into a shell when run with elevated privileges.

---

## Privilege Escalation via nano ✂️👑

Using the GTFOBins technique, nano was abused to spawn a root shell.

No kernel exploits.  
No dirty tricks.  
Just **sudo misconfiguration doing its job badly**.

---

## Root Access 🏁💀

- Root shell obtained  
- Root access confirmed  
- root.txt flag captured  

Case solved.  
Perpetrator: bad configuration.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Anonymous FTP is still a liability  
- Usernames leaked through files kill security instantly  
- Steganography is still very much alive  
- Misconfigured sudo permissions = free root  
- Simple mistakes beat complex vulnerabilities every time
