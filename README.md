# 🧠 TryHackMe Writeups — sudo0xksh 🧑‍💻🔥

Welcome to my **TryHackMe CTF Writeups Repository**.

This repo is a collection of **Easy-level (for now 👀)** TryHackMe machines solved with a  
**security researcher mindset**, not a script-kiddie speedrun.

No spoon-feeding.  
No copy-paste exploits.  
Just clean enumeration, bad configs, and systems betraying themselves.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder contains:
- A **single, clean README.md**
- Step-by-step attack flow
- Clear reasoning (why something worked)
- Light humour (because suffering should be funny)

## 🎯 Methodology

Every writeup follows the same philosophy:

- **Enumeration > Exploitation > Privilege Escalation**
- Prefer **misconfigurations over exploits**
- Abuse **human mistakes**, not magic payloads
- Explain *why* an attack worked, not just *how*

If a box falls apart due to basics — it gets called out 😌
