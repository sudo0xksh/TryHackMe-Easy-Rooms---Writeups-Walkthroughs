Lookup - TryHackMe Writeup/Walkthrough
Lookup - THM Writeup

---

Machine Overview
Machine Name: Lookup
 Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx (IP changed multiple times during the lab)
 Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu-based)
This assessment focused on web application enumeration, credential discovery through fuzzing, exploitation of a vulnerable file manager, and privilege escalation via misconfigured sudo permissions.

---

1️⃣ Initial Reconnaissance
The engagement began with a TCP scan to identify exposed services and understand the attack surface.
🔍 Nmap Scan
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx
📌 Key Findings
The following services were identified:
Port 22 (SSH)
 Service: OpenSSH 8.2p1
 OS: Ubuntu Linux
Port 80 (HTTP)
 Service: Apache httpd 2.4.41
 Redirect: lookup.thm

The presence of a hostname redirect indicated a virtual host–based web application, making HTTP the primary entry point.

---

2️⃣ Web Application Enumeration
Accessing the web application revealed a login page, confirming that authentication was a core component of the application.
Initial automated testing was performed to quickly identify common vulnerabilities:
SQL injection testing
Command injection testing

Both automated and manual testing did not reveal any direct injection vulnerabilities.
At this stage, the focus shifted from exploitation to credential discovery.

---

3️⃣ Username & Credential Discovery
Parallel fuzzing was performed against the authentication mechanism.
Through targeted enumeration:
Multiple valid usernames were identified
Notably: admin and jose

A password discovered during fuzzing attempts did not work for the admin user, but reusing the same credential for jose resulted in a successful login.
This confirmed weak credential hygiene and user-specific password reuse.

---

4️⃣ Initial Foothold via Application Vulnerability
Once authenticated, further inspection of the application revealed the use of elFinder, a web-based file manager.
The installed version of elFinder was vulnerable and allowed remote code execution.
By exploiting this vulnerability, a reverse shell was obtained, resulting in an initial foothold on the system.

---

5️⃣ Shell Stabilization & Enumeration
After stabilizing the shell, post-exploitation enumeration was performed to identify lateral movement and escalation paths.
Inspection of system binaries revealed access to a list of executables located under /usr/sbin.
These binaries became a point of interest for further access.

---

6️⃣ SSH Access
Credential testing against the SSH service was performed using discovered information.
A valid password was identified, allowing SSH access to the system.
At this stage:
Stable SSH access obtained
user.txt flag retrieved and submitted

---

7️⃣ Privilege Escalation
Privilege escalation enumeration revealed that the current user had permission to run the following binary with sudo privileges:
look
While look is typically a harmless utility, its behavior allows reading arbitrary files when misconfigured.
Cross-referencing its behavior confirmed that it could be abused to read sensitive files with elevated privileges.

---

8️⃣ Root Access
Using the permitted look command, the root flag was read directly.
Root access effectively achieved
root.txt retrieved and submitted
Full system compromise confirmed

This concluded the assessment.

🧠 Key Takeaways

Authentication mechanisms are often the weakest link in web applications
Username enumeration significantly reduces attack complexity
Credential reuse across users remains a critical security flaw
Third-party components like file managers frequently introduce RCE vectors
Misconfigured sudo permissions can trivialize privilege escalation
