# Fowsniff CTF — TryHackMe (Easy) 📧🐶🔐

Fowsniff CTF is a box that doesn’t get hacked aggressively —  
it **leaks credentials politely** and waits for you to notice.

Mail services, leaked passwords, username enumeration,  
and a script that really shouldn’t be executable.

Classic. Messy. Fun.

---

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: Fowsniff CTF  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine focuses on **multi-service enumeration**,  
**credential harvesting from public leaks**,  
and **privilege escalation via insecure script execution**.

In short: everyone reused passwords and paid for it.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍👀

Started with a standard TCP scan to see what the server proudly exposed.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Services discovered:

22/tcp   SSH     OpenSSH 7.2p2 🔐  
80/tcp   HTTP    Apache 2.4.18 🌐  
110/tcp  POP3    Dovecot 📬  
143/tcp  IMAP    Dovecot 📬  

Mail services + SSH + HTTP together is a giant neon sign saying:

👉 **“Credentials are involved. Go find them.”**

---

## Web Enumeration (Port 80) 🌐🧐

Directory enumeration was performed on the web service.

Findings:
- Directory listing enabled on some paths 📂  
- Old jQuery version (1.11.3) 🦖  
- robots.txt present but boring 😴  

No direct credentials here,  
but the site clearly confirmed the **identity and theme** of the target.

Which mattered later.

---

## Username Enumeration via SSH 👤🔎

SSH behaved… suspiciously.

By observing authentication responses,  
valid usernames could be distinguished from invalid ones.

Confirmed usernames included:

- admin  
- root  
- www-data  
- host  
- user  
- guest  

This alone cut the attack complexity in half.

Usernames confirmed = attackers smiling 😈

---

## Mail Service Enumeration (POP3 & IMAP) 📬🧠

With POP3 and IMAP exposed, targeted enumeration followed.

- Brute-force attempts kept minimal (slow responses, rate limits)  
- Authentication clearly enabled  
- No instant creds from brute forcing  

So instead of forcing services, the strategy changed:

👉 **Look outside the box.**

And that’s where things got spicy 🌶️

---

## Credential Discovery via Data Leakage 🕵️‍♂️🔥

Research related to the target revealed a **publicly leaked dataset**  
containing email addresses and password hashes tied to the organization.

Example entries:

baksteen@fowsniff : 19f5af754c31f1e2651edde9250d69bb  
seina@fowsniff    : 90dc16d47114aa13671c697fd506cf26  

After identifying the hash format and cracking carefully:

Recovered credential:

seina : scoobydoo2 🐶

This confirmed one thing:

👉 **The leak was real, and the system trusted it.**

---

## Initial Access via SSH 🔓😎

Using the leaked password logic, SSH access was attempted with another user.

Valid credentials used:

Username: baksteen  
Password: S1ck3nBluff+secureshell  

Login result?

✅ Success  
✅ User shell obtained  
✅ Initial foothold secured  

No alarms.  
No resistance.  
Just password reuse doing its thing.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀🔥

Post-exploitation enumeration focused on files executable by the user’s group.

Command used:

find / -type f -perm -010 -group $(id -gn) -ls 2>/dev/null

This revealed something dangerous 👀

A script named:

👉 **cube.sh**

- Executable by the current group  
- Running with elevated privileges  

Which is basically root access with extra steps.

---

## Root Access 🏁👑

By injecting a reverse shell payload into the script  
and triggering its execution:

- Root shell obtained  
- Root privileges confirmed  
- Full system compromise achieved  

Machine officially done.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Mail services often mean credential reuse  
- Username enumeration saves massive time  
- Public credential leaks stay valid longer than people think  
- Group-executable scripts are privilege escalation gold  
- Correlating data beats brute force every time
