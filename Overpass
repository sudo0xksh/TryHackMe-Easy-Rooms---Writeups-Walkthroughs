Overpass - TryHackMe Writeup / WalkThrough
Overpass - THM Writeup

---

Machine Overview
Machine Name: Overpass
 Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx
 Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu-based)
This assessment focused on client-side authentication bypass, credential recovery through exposed cryptographic material, and privilege escalation via a misconfigured cron job.

---

1️⃣ Initial Reconnaissance
The engagement began with a TCP scan to identify exposed services and understand the attack surface.
🔍 Nmap Scan
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx
📌 Key Findings
The following services were identified:
Port 22 (SSH)
 Service: OpenSSH 7.6p1
 OS: Ubuntu Linux
Port 80 (HTTP)
 Service: Golang net/http
 Application: Overpass

The presence of a custom web application on port 80 made HTTP the primary entry point.

---

2️⃣ Web Application Analysis
Accessing the web application revealed a login interface.
Rather than attacking the backend directly, the client-side logic was reviewed.
 During this analysis, a flaw was identified in login.js, where authentication relied on the presence of a session token rather than proper server-side validation.
By manually crafting a cookie header with a value such as:
Session: #anything
Administrative access was granted without valid credentials.
This confirmed a client-side authentication bypass.

---

3️⃣ Admin Panel Access
With access to the admin panel, sensitive internal resources became visible.
One of the most critical discoveries was an RSA private key exposed within the administrative interface.
This key appeared to belong to a system user.

---

4️⃣ Credential Recovery & Initial Access
The retrieved private key was associated with user james and protected by a passphrase.
After recovering the passphrase, SSH access was attempted using the private key.
The login was successful, resulting in a stable user-level shell.
At this point:
Initial foothold obtained
user.txt flag retrieved and submitted

---

5️⃣ Post-Exploitation Enumeration
Once inside the system, standard enumeration techniques were performed.
A critical misconfiguration was identified in the system's scheduled tasks.
A cron job was running with root privileges every minute:
* * * * * root curl overpass.thm/downloads/src/buildscript.sh | bash

This job blindly downloaded and executed a script from a remote location without validation.

---

6️⃣ Privilege Escalation via Cron Job Abuse
Because the script was fetched over HTTP and executed as root, control over the script source meant control over root execution.
By modifying the contents of buildscript.sh to include a malicious payload, arbitrary commands could be executed as root.
Once the cron job ran, the payload executed automatically.

---

7️⃣ Root Access

Root access obtained
root.txt flag retrieved and submitted
Full system compromise confirmed

This concluded the assessment.

---

🧠 Key Takeaways

Client-side authentication checks should never be trusted
Exposing cryptographic keys is equivalent to exposing credentials
Passphrase-protected keys still pose a risk if accessible
Cron jobs executing remote scripts are extremely dangerous
Trusting external content with root privileges leads to immediate compromise
