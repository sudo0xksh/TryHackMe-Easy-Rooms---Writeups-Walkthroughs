# Brute It — TryHackMe (Easy) 🧱🔨🐧

Brute It is that box which looks simple…  
acts simple…  
and then politely asks you: **“username aur password try karega?”**

No fancy bugs.  
No exploit wizardry.  
Just web enum, credential pain, and sudo being sudo.

---

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: Brute It  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine revolves around **web enumeration**, **credential brute forcing**,  
and a **misconfigured sudo setup** that ends the story quickly.

Name checks out. ✅

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍👀

Started with the mandatory “what did you expose?” scan.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Open ports discovered:

22/tcp   SSH     tcpwrapped 🔐  
80/tcp   HTTP    Apache 2.4.29 🌐  

Linux 4.x kernel detected.  
Only SSH and HTTP in play — clean, minimal, suspicious.

With SSH locked behind creds, the web service instantly became the main suspect.

---

## Web Enumeration (Port 80) 🌐🐢

Started enumerating the HTTP service.

Immediately noticed something odd:

- Scans were **slow**
- Enumeration felt **throttled**
- Tools were not having a good time

Instead of smashing Gobuster like a caveman, the approach switched to:

👉 **Manual inspection**

The website itself was minimal, but authentication was clearly involved.

No uploads.  
No fancy functionality.  
Just one clear message:

**“Credentials matter here.”**

---

## Credential Attack Strategy 🧠🎯

Given the situation:

- No obvious vulnerabilities  
- SSH locked behind authentication  
- Web app hinting at login logic  

The most logical plan became:

👉 Identify valid usernames via the website  
👉 Perform **controlled brute-force attempts**

The machine name literally said *Brute It* — subtlety was not invited.

---

## Initial Access 🔑😎

Through careful enumeration and credential testing:

- Valid credentials were discovered  
- SSH login was successful  

Results:
- User-level shell obtained  
- user.txt flag captured  

Partial compromise achieved.  
Time to disrespect sudo.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀🔥

Post-exploitation enumeration began.

Checked sudo permissions.

And of course…

👉 The user could run certain commands as root **without a password**.

The command list looked limited — but limited ≠ safe.

Cross-checked allowed binaries with known techniques.

GTFOBins smiled back 😈

## Root Access 🏁👑

By abusing the allowed sudo configuration:

- Root shell obtained  
- Root privileges confirmed  
- root.txt flag captured  

Full system compromise achieved.

No kernel exploits.  
No tricks.  
Just **bad sudo decisions**.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Even minimal web apps can enable brute-force paths  
- Slow enumeration ≠ secure service  
- SSH is only as strong as its credentials  
- Misconfigured sudo is still a golden ticket  
- Simple setups often fall the hardest

## Final Words ☕😌

Brute It teaches one honest lesson:

> “If credentials are weak, everything else is optional.”

Patient enumeration.  
Basic logic.  
Free root.

Easy box.  
Straightforward mistakes.
